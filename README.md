# Alpha Research and Factor Modeling
*Udacity - AI for Trading Nanodegree Program*

## Project Overview
* Build a statistical risk model using PCA. 
* Use this model to build a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors. 
* Evaluate the factors using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis. 
* Optimize the portfolio using the risk model and factors using multiple optimization formulations. 

For the dataset, the end of day from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar are used.
